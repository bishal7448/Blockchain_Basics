## Modifier

A modifier is a special type of function in Solidity that helps reduce code duplication by allowing reusable logic to be applied across multiple functions within the same contract. Modifiers are commonly used to define prerequisites or conditions that must be met before a function is executed. They are added to the function signature to enforce these conditions.
