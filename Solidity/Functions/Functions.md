# Solidity Functions

A function is a block of code that performs a task. It can be called and reused multiple times. You can pass information to a function, and it can send information back.

# Setter and Getter Functions

When you call a setter function, it creates a transaction that needs to be mined and costs gas, because it changes the blockchain state.
In contrast, a getter function is a read-only call that does not create a transaction, doesn't cost gas, and does not change the blockchain.
